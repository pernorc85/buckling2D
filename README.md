# bucklingWithGrowth

matlab program to calculate growth induced buckling mode based on material property.

One-layer problem has been validated against isotropic counterpart in work of Derek.E.Moulton(2011).
Derek ignores an important problem that circumferential growth in isotropic tube almost doesn't cause automatic buckling. In anisotropic tube, automatic buckling can happend for certain fiber orientation.
